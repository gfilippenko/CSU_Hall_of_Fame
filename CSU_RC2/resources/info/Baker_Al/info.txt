Al Baker became one of the backbones on the Big Green defense of the 1970s and broke through opposing offensive lines like no other Ram before. Baker teamed with All-American Mike Bell to make a one-two punch defense that helped the Rams to a 9-2-1 season in 1977. Baker was also an outstanding basketball player for the Rams, but never lettered in the sport since football was his primary focus. He was selected as an All-Conference defensive lineman in 1977 and also selected to play in the 1977 Blue-Gray Classic. 

In 1978, Baker was chosen by the Detroit Lions in the second round of the NFL Draft making him the 40th pick overall. He spent 13 seasons in the NFL with the Lions, Cardinals, Browns and Vikings making All-Pro one time and was selected to three Pro Bowl teams. Following his career in the NFL, Baker opened a successful barbeque restaurant called “Bubba’s Q” in the Cleveland area.
