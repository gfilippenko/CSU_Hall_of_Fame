Jim David may be regarded as one of the greatest members of the Detroit Lions during the 1950s, but before he was a world champion in Detroit he tore up the gridiron at Colorado A&M. Known as “Rebel” because of his South Carolina roots, David joined the varsity football team in 1949 as an end to help the Aggies to a 9-1 record. David’s sure hands made him one of the best receivers in the T-offense of Coach Bob Davis and in 1951 he led the nation in receptions until the last week of the season. He finished the 1951 football season second in the nation for receptions and was named to the all-conference team at the conclusion of the season.

David was also a member of the Colorado A&M Baseball team that won the 1950 Skyline Conference championship. That team is the only CSU baseball team to play in a College World Series.
 
David’s tough defensive play with the Aggies in the backfield caught the attention of the Detroit Lions and he was taken in the 22nd round of the 1952 NFL Draft. He joined former Aggie teammates Fum McGraw and Jack Christiansen and dominated the Detroit backfield winning three world championships. David was named to six Pro Bowl teams during his eight-year career in the NFL and later joined Christiansen’s coaching staff with the San Francisco 49ers. Jim David died in 2007 in his hometown of Florence, South Carolina.
