Virginia Frank is credited with the formation of modern women’s athletics at Colorado State University. A native of Wisconsin, Virginia Frank came to Colorado A&M to assist long-time women’s athletic director Elizabeth Forbes coaching the women of the school in intramural athletics. By 1959, Forbes had retired and Frank helped to form the first women’s track team for intercollegiate competition. She continued to coach field hockey, basketball, softball, volleyball and tennis for intramural play, but championed for women to compete against other schools and at the national level. She also coached the men’s soccer team for two seasons.

Virginia Frank was the chairperson of Olympic Track and Field for the Rocky Mountain Region from 1957 to 1965 and took the first CSU women track athletes to a national championship meet in Detroit in 1959.  In 1976, CSU named the Virginia K. Frank Award in her honor, given to the most outstanding female athlete each year.
