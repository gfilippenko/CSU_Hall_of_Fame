Duane Hartshorn is likely known more as a physician than he was as an outstanding athlete on the Aggie gridiron and basketball court. Any athlete that played at CSU from 1930 to 1969 knew him as “Doc Hartshorn”, while he worked as the team physician. However, Hartshorn was the backbone of the 1919 and 1920 championship football teams as a bruising halfback on Aggie teams that dominated the Rocky Mountain region. Hartshorn was selected to the All-Conference football teams three times (1919, 1920 and 1921) along with an All-Conference selection in basketball in 1921. 

Following graduation, Hartshorn taught at Brush High School before receiving his Doctor of Medicine in 1929. He returned to the Aggie campus in 1930 to establish the school’s first student health center, which became a model for other schools nationally. A veteran of WWI, Hartshorn served as a commanding officer during WWII as medical support rising to the rank of Colonel in 1943. Although he remained in private practice, Hartshorn continued to serve his alma mater in numerous capacities and in 1960 oversaw the design and construction of the student health center on the CSU campus that bears his name today. Hartshorn died in June of 1969 at the age of 69, the Hartshorn Student Health Center was named in his honor in 1970.
