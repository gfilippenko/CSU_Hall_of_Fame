Harry Hughes, later known as the Dean of American Football Coaches, arrived on the campus of Colorado Agricultural College in September of 1911 and forever changed athletics at the school known today as Colorado State University. A 1908 graduate of the University of Oklahoma, Hughes molded and shaped the Colorado Aggies in football and track to become one of the premier college athletic programs in the Rocky Mountain Region. He also coached basketball and baseball for a brief period, but it was his football teams that won eight conference championships between 1915 and 1934 that gained the school national attention.
    
As track coach Hughes won five conference championships, produced seven All-Americans, including 1931 Hammer national champion Ivan Dykeman. Hughes also coached 1936 Olympic Decathlon Gold Medalist Glenn Morris and integrated college football ahead of other Colorado schools beginning in 1939. He is responsible for helping the school build Colorado Field, the Glenn Morris Field House and he laid out the campus design for all athletics to be moved to the west campus. During his 42 years as director of athletics, the Aggies won 60 conference championships in seven different men’s sports. Harry Hughes died just 26 days after his retirement in 1953 at the age of 65. CSU named Hughes Stadium in his honor when it was completed in 1968.
