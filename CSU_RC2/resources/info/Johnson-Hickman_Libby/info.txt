Libbie Johnson-Hickman attended high school in Cairo, Egypt before coming to Colorado State University in 1984. Her career as a distance runner blossomed at CSU between 1984 and 1988. In her senior year, Johnson won the 1988 All-American award for the 3,000 meter run, setting a school record and becoming the only woman in school history to win that event as an All-American.

It was her career after running at CSU that has made her one of America’s most successful distance runners. After beginning a professional career, Johnson-Hickman exploded onto the running scene in 1997 when she won the Bolder-Boulder, was named the top women’s US road racer of 1997 and honored as the 1997 Colorado Sportswoman of the year. After her amazing 1997 season, Johnson-Hickman competed in the Goodwill games and won a spot on the 2000 US Olympic team competing in the 10,000 meter race, finishing 16th in the finals. She has racked up more road racing wins than any other woman in CSU history and remains in Fort Collins competing in several events.
