Brady Keys came to Colorado State University after a semi-pro career took him to California following his high school days in Austin, Texas. Considered a highly recruited player, Keys immediately made an impact on the Rams team in 1959 and again in 1960. For the 1960 season, Keys led the team in rushing yards and total offense. 

Keys was chosen in the 14th round of the 1960 NFL draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers and played defensive back from 1961 to 1967. He briefly played for the Vikings and Cardinals before hanging up his football jersey. After his NFL playing career, Keys went into business and became the first African American owner of a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant. He later formed Keys Group to help under privileged children and youth groups.
