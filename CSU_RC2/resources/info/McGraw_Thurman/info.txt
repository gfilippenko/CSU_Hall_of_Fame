One of the greatest names in school history, there are few things that Fum McGraw did not do during the 40 years he competed in athletics or worked for Colorado State University. McGraw was the third brother to attend Colorado A&M College and a native of Paonia, Colorado. Fum excelled in all three sports he participated in during his four years as an Aggie athlete and earned All-American awards in football (1948, 1949), track (discus 1949) and wrestling (1948). He is the first consensus football All-American for CSU and the only athlete in school history to be awarded an All-American in three different sports. Also a member of the 1949 Raisin Bowl team, Fum went on to a career in the NFL that spanned five seasons and won two world championships with the Detroit Lions. 
    
After his NFL career, he returned to his alma mater to be an assistant coach in football and wrestling. After a short stint in the NFL as an assistant coach, McGraw was named the school’s assistant athletic director in 1965 under Jim Williams. He played an integral part in the construction of Moby Arena and Hughes Stadium before leaving in 1968. In 1976, he returned to CSU as the school’s director of athletics where he remained until his retirement in 1986. In 1997, CSU named the new McGraw Athletic Center in his honor. Fum McGraw died in 2000 at the age of 73.
