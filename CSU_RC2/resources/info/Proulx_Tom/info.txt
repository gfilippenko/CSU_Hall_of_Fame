Tom Proulx became the first CSU gymnast to win a national championship when he took the NCAA title in the floor exercise in 1970. A transfer from Pasadena Junior College in 1968, Proulx immediately made an impact at CSU following his arrival and placed second in the NCAA Gymnastics Tournament for the floor exercise in 1969. He was also a member of the trampoline team that placed second in the nation in 1970. In his senior year, he became the first member of the gymnastic team to be awarded the Nye Trophy.

After his athletic eligibility ended in 1970, Proulx took time off from school, but returned to CSU in 1974 to earn his degree, graduating in 1975. While he finished his degree, Proulx coached the CSU Womenâ€™s Gymnastics team in the 1974-75 season. In 1976, Proulx was a member of the US tumbling team that finished second in the world meet. He later coached gymnastics at The Lakes Academy in Arvada, Colorado.
