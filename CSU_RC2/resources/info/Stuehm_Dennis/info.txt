Dennis Stuehm was one of the backbones to the first basketball conference championship in school history and concluded his career at Colorado A&M on top of every major category. He made an impact on Coach Bill Strannigan’s team beginning in his junior year of 1952-53. Stuehm led the team in points per game and was chosen as an all-conference player for the season. However, in his senior year of 1953-54, Stuehm once again led in scoring and took the all-conference honors along with being named the Skyline Conference Most Valuable Player. As of 2012, four of Stuehm’s records still rank in the top ten in school history. When he graduated he held the school record in five categories. 

Stuehm was drafted by the NBA for the 1954 draft but declined for a career in the farming business. He worked in Sterling and Ault serving on the Highland School Board for eight years and is now retired.
