Chester Cruikshank was truly an athletic hero and war hero that made Colorado State proud during and after his career with the Aggies. A 1931 graduate of Ault High School, Cruikshank was an outstanding athlete in track and field winning five All-American awards; three in hammer and two in discus. In 1935, Cruikshank won the national AAU title in the hammer throw. He later topped his collegiate record in 1939 winning an AAU national title once again in hammer. Cruikshank was recognized as an all-conference track athlete and also carried his success onto the gridiron. He helped Harry Hughes win his seventh and eighth conference championships in football and was named as the all-conference end in 1934.

Following his athletic days, Cruikshank entered into the Army in 1940 with the 180th Infantry. From 1940 to 1945, Cruikshank saw action in North Africa, Italy and France winning two Bronze Stars, one Silver Star, the Distinguished Service Cross, Croix de Guerre and was wounded three times earning a Purple Heart with two oak leaf clusters. After the war, Cruikshank returned to farming near La Junta and served on the governing board of CSU and Fort Lewis from 1958 to 1966. Cruikshank died in November of 1970 at the age of 57.
