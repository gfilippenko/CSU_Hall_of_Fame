Bob Davis, a former quarterback for the University of Utah in the late 1920s, came to Colorado A&M College in 1947 to take over the post-war Aggies football program. He coached CSU Hall of Famers Fum McGraw, Jack Christiansen, Dale Dodrill, Jim David, Don Burroughs, Alex Burl, Gary Glick and more. In his second season as the head football coach, Davis took the Aggies to the 1949 Raisin Bowl, the first in school history. His 1949 team posted a 9-1 record, just missing the conference championship for the second year in a row.

His .618 winning percentage over the nine seasons he coached football is the best winning percentage for any head football coach at CSU with more than five years at the helm. In 1955 he coached his last season of football and the Colorado A&M Aggie-Rams won the Skyline Conference Championship.

He succeeded Harry Hughes in 1953 as athletic director and after the 1955 football season stepped down from coaching to concentrate full time on his duties as director of athletics. Davis worked tirelessly to balance the athletic budget with so little money available to him and was instrumental in getting Moby Arena and Hughes Stadium built. Davis was unable to see the facilities opened and died of cancer in 1965 at the age of 56.
