Crawford Eugene Grenard, known as Gene to all, came to Colorado State from the small town of Swink in Southeastern Colorado without ever having wrestled in high school. While practicing on the freshman football team, Coach Hans Wagner discovered Grenard’s talents and taught him the sport of wrestling from the ground up. Grenard helped guide the Aggies to three team conference championships and also won an individual championship in the eastern division of the Skyline Conference in 1939 and 1940. In 1939 Grenard wrestled in the semi-finals of the NCAA national wrestling tournament in the 155 pound class, but it was in 1940 that he returned to the national championships and won the only individual NCAA wrestling title in school history. 

After graduation in May of 1940, with a degree in electrical engineering, Grenard entered into active military duty as a 2nd Lieutenant. From 1943 to 1945 he served in the China, Burma, India theatre and helped train Chinese soldiers to fire mortars. When he returned from the war, Grenard came home to Southeastern Colorado and farmed where he became active in the Swink school board and helped establish high school wrestling in Otero County. He also wrestled professionally when other named wrestlers came through town. Grenard later coached and worked as an official for high school wrestling in Otero County. Grenard worked for the Colorado Department of Agriculture for 20 years and retired to San Diego in 1983. Gene Grenard died in 1989 at the age of 69.
