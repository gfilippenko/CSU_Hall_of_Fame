Del Hessel is arguably one of the greatest track and field coaches in school history guiding 20 different athletes to All-American awards. Hessel was an award winning runner at CSU in the early 1960s setting the school record in the 800 meter indoors in 1963 and was the 1962 Skyline Conference champion in the 800 meter. Along with the Nye Award in 1964, Hessel received the Williams Award for most outstanding track athlete as a senior. After his running days at CSU, Hessel coached at Grand Junction and Boulder High School before coming back to his alma mater as head coach of the track team in 1970.

From 1970 to 1976, Hessel coached 10 All-Americans and several individual WAC champion athletes. Hessel left CSU in 1976 to coach at Western Kentucky University and later at the University of New Mexico between 1976 and 1990. Following his induction into the CSU Athletic Hall of Fame, Hessel returned to CSU to assist head track coach Doug Max and also take over as the head coach of cross country. When Max was promoted to associate athletic director in 1999, Hessel took over as head coach of track for a second time garnering national acclaim in cross country and other track events. Hessel has brought national and international attention on the CSU track program and retired from his position as head coach in 2006.
