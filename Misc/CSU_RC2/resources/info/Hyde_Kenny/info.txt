Kenny Hyde has the distinction of being the first athlete from a Colorado school named to any All-America football team. Hyde arrived at Colorado Agricultural College in the fall of 1922 with his brother Erle and in his freshman year ran on the track team. During his three seasons on the varsity football team, Hyde became the Aggies’ first triple threat halfback having the ability to pass, run and kick the ball. This gained him national attention and after a he guided his team to a 9-win season, Hyde was named to the Associated Press All-America team for 1925 as a third team quarterback. He also won all-conference in football for 1925 and was one of the school’s earliest all-conference basketball players. 

Following the 1925 football season the Chicago Bears and George Halas offered him the opportunity to play in the NFL, but Hyde did not agree with professional football and turned to a successful career as an educator and coach in Lafayette, Englewood and Greeley high schools. Hyde then opened his own men’s clothing store in Eaton, Colorado supporting CSU athletics until his death in 1977.
