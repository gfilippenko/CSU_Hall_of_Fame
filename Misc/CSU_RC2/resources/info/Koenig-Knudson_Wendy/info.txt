Wendy Koenig-Knudson still ranks as one of the greatest track athletes in CSU history as a highly accomplished middle-distance runner. Koenig-Knudsen competed in the 1972 Munich Olympics just after she graduated from Estes Park High School. Her fifth place finish in the first round of the 800-meter competition set the pace for her career at Colorado State University. While at CSU she was named to the 1975 and 1976 800-Meters All-American teams and the 1976 1,500 Meters All-America team. She still holds the school record for 800 Meters and 1,500 Meters and also still holds the state collegiate record in the 800 Meters

In 1976, Koenig-Knudson qualified for her second Olympics and finished third in the semi-finals with a 1:59:91 time becoming only the second American woman to break the two-minute mark.  In the finals she finished seventh overall and was the top American in the competition. After the Montreal Olympics, Koenig-Knudson continued to put up excellent results winning 880 and 800 Meters Indoor meets in 1977 and 1979. At the 1979 US Indoor Nationals meet she won her second national championship in the 880 Meters. She was also on the Dean’s list for academic achievement while at CSU and graduated with honors.
