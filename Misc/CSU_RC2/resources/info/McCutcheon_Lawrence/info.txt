Lawrence “The Clutch” McCutcheon is the first player in school history to rush for over 1,000 yards in a season and helped define a new generation of running backs at Colorado State University. The halfback from Plainview, Texas arrived at CSU in 1969 and immediately churned out 797 yards in his sophomore year before a broken wrist sidelined him. In 1970, McCutcheon ran for 1,008 yards to become the first CSU player to rush over 1,000 yards and did it again in his senior year rushing for 1,112 yards in the 1971 season. McCutcheon also kept in shape in the off-season running track for two years. 

He was an honorable mention All-American in 1970 by the Associated Press and 1969 WAC Back of the Year. In 1969, McCutcheon became the first Ram to rush for over 200 yards in a game and did it again in 1970, finishing his career with eight games rushing over 100 yards. The Clutch set the tone for great running backs in the 1970s and finished his career with 2,917 yards rushing, still ranked fifth in school history. He went on to play in the NFL, mostly with the Los Angeles Rams and continues to work for the St. Louis Rams organization.
