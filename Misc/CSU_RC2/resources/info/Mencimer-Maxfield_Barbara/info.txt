Barbara Mencimer came from an excellent athletic background as the daughter of Aggie graduates Catherine Longmore and Aggie football great Floyd Mencimer. Barbara Mencimer used her great athletic background to compete in a multitude of women’s athletics at a time when little emphasis was given to women in intercollegiate athletics. Mencimer competed in field hockey, track, badminton, tennis, skiing, swimming, basketball, volleyball and softball. Although not all sports competed with other schools, Mencimer’s contributions helped build the foundation for women’s intercollegiate athletics at CSU.

Following graduation in 1959, Mencimer taught physical education in nearby LaPorte and later coached softball at the University of Utah. She returned to Colorado and earned her master’s degree in physical education from the University of Northern Colorado. She received a second degree from CSU in social work and later became a professor at Aims College in Greeley.
