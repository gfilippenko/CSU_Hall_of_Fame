Marcia Middel came to Colorado State University to compete in Women’s Swimming as a transfer student from Calvin College and broke ground in women’s athletics prior to Title IX. From the moment she competed with Coach Nancy O’Connor’s team, her swimming career took off and placed her among the very elite of collegiate swimmers in the country. Middel won the National Championship in the 50-yard butterfly in 1970, 1971 and 1972. She also won the 100-yard butterfly and placed among the top-three in the 50 and 100-yard freestyle events. During the three years she competed at CSU, Middle never finished lower than third in any event. She also helped guide Coach O’Connor’s teams to three consecutive third place finishes in the national competition.

After graduation, Middle competed with the Women’s National Cross Country Ski Team and received masters and doctoral degrees in psychology. While she studied for her doctoral degree at the University of Denver, Middle also coached the Pioneers until her final year in school. Dr. Marcia Middel is an award-winning psychologist and director at MHCD in Denver.
