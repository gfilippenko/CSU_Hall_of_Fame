Oscar “Golden Shoes” Reed defined the modern day running back at Colorado State University during his stellar career in a Rams uniform. At Booker T. Washington High School in Memphis, Tennessee, Reed earned the nickname “Golden Shoes” when he spray painted his cleats gold following a record-breaking season. Reed chewed up more yards than any post WWII back to that date for CSU beginning in his sophomore season. In 1965 he broke the school record for yards rushed in a season with 725 and backed it up in his 1966 junior year with 946 yards. After rushing for 910 yards in his senior season, Reed finished his CSU career with 2,581 yards rushing. He held the school record for most career rushing yards until 1971 and remains in the top ten at CSU all-time. Reed received national recognition in 1966 when he rushed for 194 yards against West Texas State and Sports Illustrated recognized him with the National Back of the Week Award for his accomplishment.

Reed went on to the NFL being chosen in the seventh round of the 1968 draft by the Minnesota Vikings. While in Minnesota from 1968 to 1974, Reed played on three Super Bowl teams rushing for 1,968 yards for the Vikings. Reed finished his NFL career with the Atlanta Falcons in 1975 and went into business and community leadership in Minneapolis.
