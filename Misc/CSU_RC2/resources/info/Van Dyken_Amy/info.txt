Amy Van Dyken defied all odds and not only overcame asthma as a child but won six Olympic Gold Medals eclipsing all other CSU athletes in Olympic competition. When she transferred from the University of Arizona in 1993, Van Dyken had already won 12 All-American awards with the Wildcats. It was her training with legendary CSU swimming coach John Mattos that took her to world class status. In 1994, Van Dyken won the NCAA championship in the 50-freestyle setting a new American record. In 1994 Van Dyken was named as the NCAA Female Swimmer of the year. She also wrapped up second place finishes in the 100-meter freestyle and 100-meter butterfly in 1994.

Her success and coaching at CSU propelled her into an Olympic career that earned her six gold medals and the only appearance of a former CSU athlete on a Wheaties box. In 1995, Van Dyken moved to Colorado Springs to train for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta and won five gold medals at the Pan American and Pan Pacific games. After making the USA swim team, Van Dyken won gold medals in the 50-meter freestyle, 100-meter freestyle, 4x100-meter freestyle relay and the 4x100-meter medley relay. After taking home four gold medals from the 1996 Olympics, Van Dyken won three gold medals at the 1998 World Aquatic Championships in Perth, Australia. Van Dykenâ€™s career did not end there and she took home two more Olympic Gold medals at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia bringing her total of Olympic gold medals to six. Van Dyken, who is married to former Denver Bronco punter Tom Rouen, is retired from athletics and speaks at numerous events along with hosting a radio show.
