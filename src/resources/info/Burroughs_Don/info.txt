Don Burroughs tore up the Aggie gridiron during the 1951 and 1952 football seasons as one of the league’s premier quarterbacks along with being a tough and confident defensive back. A transfer from Ventura Junior College in California, Burroughs took control of the Colorado A&M backfield in 1951 and earned all-conference honors in 1952. His quick scrambling agility and ability to throw the ball made him the first quarterback in school history to pass for more than 1,000 yards in a season in 1951. (1,279)

Following graduation, Burroughs was signed by the Los Angeles Rams as a non-drafted player and had to spend two years in the Army before playing his first down of football in the NFL. In 1955 he played for the L.A. Rams and was given the nickname “Blade” due to his 6’ 5” height and quickly became one of the finest defensive backs in the NFL. In 1960, Burroughs was acquired by the Philadelphia Eagles upon the request of former Ram teammate Nor Van Brocklin. The Eagles won the 1960 World Championship and Burroughs spent five seasons in Philadelphia before retiring in 1964. During his NFL career, Burroughs appeared in a 1960 episode of the Donna Reed Show and was a voice actor in four other productions as late as 1994. Burroughs died in 2006 following a lengthy battle with cancer.
