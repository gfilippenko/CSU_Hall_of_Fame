Norm Cable arrived on the campus of Colorado State College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts in the fall of 1934 to begin his athletic career with the Colorado Aggies. A two-sport letterman, Cable excelled on the gridiron during his career and was one of CU All-American Byron “Whizzer” White’s greatest nemeses’ in the great 1936 game in Fort Collins. Cable played end and punted in football and ran with the track team all four years he attended the school.

Following graduation in 1938, Cable was invited to try out for the Green Bay Packers and later played professionally with the Cleveland Rams. Injuries plagued him during his career, but Cable is one of the earliest professional football players in Colorado State history. Cable was an adamant supporter of CSU athletics until his death in 2003.
