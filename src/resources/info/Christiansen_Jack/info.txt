Jack Christiansen came to Colorado A&M College in the fall of 1947 as a track athlete and left in the spring of 1951 as a football legend. Christiansen’s talents on the track were recognized by Coach Harry Hughes and in 1948 he was recommended to try out for the football team. In the first football game he appeared in for the Aggies on November 20, 1948, Christiansen ran back a punt 89 yards for a touchdown against the University of Colorado. He played on the 1949 Raisin Bowl team and set numerous records in punt return average and yards rushing. Christiansen also won three conference championships in the quarter mile and was named to the all-conference football team in 1949 and 1950. 
Following graduation in 1951, Christiansen was drafted by the Detroit Lions and helped win four league titles and three World Championships. His defensive backfield in Detroit was known as “Chris’ Crew” and is still regarded as one of the greatest defensive backfields in NFL history. Christiansen went on to be the head football coach at Stanford University and with the San Francisco 49ers. He died in 1986; two years later Colorado State University named its new track facility “Jack Christiansen Track” in his honor.
