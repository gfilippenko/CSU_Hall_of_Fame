    Dale Dodrill followed the same path that many 18-year-old men followed in 1942. After winning the state high school football championship at Loveland in 1942, Dodrill joined the Army and fought Nazis rather than fight on a gridiron. When he returned home from the war, Dodrill chose Colorado A&M because he could play as a freshman on the varsity squad for coach Bob Davis in 1947. Dodrill played all four years for the Aggies and helped lead the team to the 1949 Raisin Bowl and an overall 28-11-1 record during his career. He played with CSU legends like Fum McGraw, Jim David, Eddie Hanna and Jack Christiansen. 
    
	After graduation, Dodrill was chosen in the sixth round of the 1951 NFL draft and played nine seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. In 1960 he joined the newly formed Denver Broncos of the American Football League as a coach and retired from football in 1965 to operate a successful insurance business.
