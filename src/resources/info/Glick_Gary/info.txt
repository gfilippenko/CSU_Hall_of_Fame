    Gary Glick was the third of four brothers from LaPorte, CO to play football at Colorado State between 1949 and 1958. After high school he went into the Navy and sharpened his athletic skills before coming back home in 1952 to attend Colorado A&M. As the teamâ€™s halfback and quarterback, Glick ran, passed and kicked his way into the national spotlight beginning in a come-from-behind victory over the University of Utah in 1954. He was awarded the Back of the Week Award in November 1954 for his efforts and that helped garner him attention by the national press and NFL scouts. 
    
	Glick helped lead the 1955 football team to a conference championship and was named to the Associated Press second team All-America. He was the first Academic All-American in CSU football history and his eight interceptions in 1954 remains the school record for interceptions in a season. 
    
	Glick was chosen as the number one overall pick in the 1956 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He played in the NFL for the Steelers, Redskins and Colts before moving to the AFL to play for the San Diego Chargers where he won the AFL Championship.
