Boyd “Tiny” Grant is a name synonymous with Colorado State University basketball both as a player and as one of the finest coaches in school history. Grant came to Colorado A&M in 1955 to play guard for legendary coach Jim Williams during the early days of Williams’ long career with the Rams. After graduation he cut his teeth as a coach in the high school ranks and in 1960 returned to Colorado State University to assist Williams. Grant spent 12 years as Williams’ assistant coach and as assistant freshman coach. The teams coached by Williams and Grant won a conference championship in 1961 and participated in four NCAA Tournaments.
