    Bill Green remains the finest basketball player to ever grace the court at Colorado State University and the only one to have ever been named a first-team All-American. During his three seasons on Coach Jim Williams’ varsity squad, Green averaged 22.1 points per game and scored a total of 1,682 points, second in school history behind Pat Durham. In 1963 he scored 649 points and made 219 field goals, second and first in school history respectively. Green was named by six different groups as a first-team All-American in 1963 and also was named as a two-time All-Conference player by the Skyline Conference.
    
	During his career, Green helped lead the Rams to a conference championship in 1961 and led the team to the NCAA tournament in 1963. Following his amazing 1963 season, the Boston Celtics chose Green in the first round of the 1963 NBA draft. However, Green’s fear of flying made him decide on a career in education in the New York City public schools where he became one of the foremost educators in that district. He died in 1994 working as the principal at Jordan L. Mott Jr. High School in the Bronx, NY at the age of 52
