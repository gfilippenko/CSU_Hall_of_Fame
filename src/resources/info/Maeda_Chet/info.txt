Chester Maeda, known by many as Chet, came to Colorado State in the fall of 1940 from a junior college in his native Los Angeles, California where he played one season at end. Upon arriving to play with the Aggies, Maeda was inserted at the halfback position and quickly fit in as a prolific passer. Playing with CSU greats like Bus Bergman, John Mosley and receiver Dude Dent, Chet Maeda won all-conference honors in his senior season of 1942. Maeda also played guard on the Aggie basketball team and ran on the track team for three years before WWII ended his career. Maeda was drafted by the Detroit Lions in 1943, but he decided to finish his education and graduated from Colorado State in 1944.

After serving in the US Army during WWII, Maeda signed with the Chicago Cardinals of the NFL and played in only one game. He then received his DVM and opened his own veterinary clinic in Southern California. Maeda continued to operate his clinic and later in life coached little league baseball. Chet Maeda died on December 21, 2005 at the age of 87.
