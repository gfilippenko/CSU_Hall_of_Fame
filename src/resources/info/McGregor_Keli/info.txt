Keli McGregor is a CSU football great that started out as a walk-on player when he arrived on the practice field in 1981 and became an All-American by his senior year. McGregor earned his way onto the varsity squad very quickly during the 1981 season. By 1983, he was rated as one of the finest tight ends in the nation catching an NCAA record 69 passes only to be surpassed in the last week of the season. Named to the UPI and AP second team All-America, McGregor was also named to the second team All-WAC in 1983 and 1984 despite his record-setting ’83 season. His 153 career receptions remains fifth most in school history and his 69 in one season remains a school record for tight ends; third most in a season overall.

Following his career at CSU, McGregor briefly played in the NFL for the Broncos, Colts and Seahawks before moving on the college athletic administration in the SEC. He worked his way up through the Colorado Rockies Major League Baseball franchise and in 2001 was named as the team’s president. Under McGregor’s leadership as president, the Rockies won the 2007 National League Championship. McGregor’s life was cut short on April 20, 2010 and he died on a business trip with the Rockies at the age of 48. The Keli S. McGregor memorial scholarship endowment was established in 2010 for walk-on CSU football players.
