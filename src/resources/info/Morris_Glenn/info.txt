Glenn Morris continues to rank as one of the greatest athletes to ever come out of Colorado State University. A native of Simla, Colorado Morris came to CSU (then known as Colorado Agricultural College) in 1930 and found a friend, coach and father-figure in the legendary Harry Hughes. Morris played end in football and ran a multitude of track sports during his career with the Aggies, but ironically the man later given the title of “Greatest Athlete in the World” was not named to any All-American teams. He was selected to the all-conference football team in 1933, the same year he helped lead CAC to the conference championship.
    
Following graduation, the former class president worked under Hughes as an assistant coach for both football and track in 1934 and 1935. While working as the assistant coach, Morris continued to train under Hughes for the 1936 Olympics and was chosen to represent the USA in Berlin. Morris stunned the world with his performance in the Decathlon, winning the event and taking home the gold; his record in the event held until 1950. He later played for the Detroit Lions before serving in the US Navy during WWII. In 2011 his gold medal was donated to CSU and the field house where he trained was renamed in his honor as the Glenn Morris Field House. Morris died in 1974 at the age of 61.
