Dr. Nancy O’Connor is a pioneer of women’s athletics at Colorado State University and championship swimming coach that placed CSU in the forefront of women’s sports. O’Connor, a graduate of the University of Northern Iowa, came to Colorado State University in 1964 and established the school’s first women’s swimming and diving team. From 1964 to 1977, she amassed a 118-4 record in dual meets, winning seven regional championships and finishing in the top ten nationally five different times. Five of her athletes set national records in women’s swimming. In 1975, Dr. O’Connor became the director of women’s athletics and worked with Fum McGraw until the department brought all athletics under one director.

While she was the director of women’s athletics, Dr. O’Connor oversaw the establishment of the varsity women’s programs established through Title IX. Under her direction women’s basketball, volleyball, softball and LaCrosse were created. CSU entered into the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women and the High Country Athletic Conference under her direction, the first women’s athletic conferences in school history. Dr. O’Connor retied from CSU in 1991 to her home in Fort Collins.
