Bob Robbins came to CSU after graduating from Thomas Jefferson High School in Denver with all-state honors in gymnastics. Highly recruited by schools like Temple and Washington, Robbins chose to stay in Colorado thanks to his coach Steve Johnson. Robbins immediately made an impact in his freshman season edging out one of the nation’s top six competitors in the floor exercise. A year later, Robbins went to the NCAA championships in Philadelphia, PA and won the national championship in the floor exercise beating famed gymnast Curt Thomas. Robbins’ CSU career continued until 1979 when he won an All-American award in both floor exercise and vaulting. 

After his CSU career, Robbins competed in regional and national gymnastic meets finishing in the top six every year until 1989. He also worked as a judge of Colorado high school gymnastics and as a coach for regional teams.
