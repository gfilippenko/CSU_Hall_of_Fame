Earlie Thomas came from Denton, Texas to study as an entomologist and decided that he needed a football scholarship to attend CSU. In the summer of 1967, Thomas convinced Coach Mike Lude to give him a chance as a walk-on football player and by the end of summer drills, Thomas made the team. After a devastating injury in the first game ever played at Hughes Stadium, Thomas bounced back in 1969 to become a fierce defensive back for the Rams. He learned his skills working out with NFL football players during the off-season.

In January of 1970, Thomas was drafted by the New York Jets where he played defensive back for five seasons. In 1975, Thomas came back to Colorado to play one season with the Denver Broncos before his retirement from pro football. In 1975, Thomas earned his masterâ€™s degree in entomology from CSU and became a local coach of track and football.
