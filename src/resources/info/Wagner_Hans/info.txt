Hans Wagner remains as one of the finest coaches in school history and one of the greatest wrestling coaches in NCAA history. As a student at Colorado Agricultural College, Wagner was a three-time all-conference football player, won four league wrestling titles and set conference records in discus and shot-put. In 1925 as the captain of the football team, Wagner helped lead the Aggies to the school’s first nine-win season and the conference championship. 
    
After graduation in 1927, Wagner became the head wrestling coach and was Harry Hughes’ assistant coach in football and track for 15 seasons. He was the head football coach from 1942 to 1946 and then became the head coach of freshman football from 1947 to 1955. As one of the greatest wrestling coaches in the nation, Wagner won 26 conference championships, trained Gene Grenard as a national champion in 1940 and brought the NCAA wrestling tournament to the Colorado A&M campus twice. He was a member of the National Rules Committee for Wrestling and trained other CSU greats like Don “Tuffy” Mullison, Fum McGraw and Ollie Woods. Hans Wagner resigned from coaching in 1956 to take a job in the university as the coordinator of new construction, but was tragically killed in a car accident in 1960.
